# ShopShop shoppinglist
## Description
This is a small Android shopping list app.
It illustrates how to implement the following features in a recyclerview:
* Left/right swipe on a list item to remove it (+ snackbar undo)
* Drag and drop list items
* Long press to select a list item, short press to select multiple (or deselect)

It also has the following features:
* The toolbar menu items change according to the current selection (nothing, one item, multiple items)
* Sort by (article) name
* Copy (selected) articles to clipboard
* Remove all articles or only the selection
* Strikethrought selected articles
* Stores everything in a local sqlite database

The 'leave app' action (imposed in the assignment) only brings the user back to the home screen without closing the app.
